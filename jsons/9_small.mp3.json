It says that in the question of 2 integers, N and M. Then it says that you have to define 2 integers, N1 and N2 and finally return their difference. Now let's see what should be the number 1 and number 2 according to them. N1 says that you have to define all the numbers in the question that are not divisible by M. Whatever is the number 1. Number 2 says that all the numbers are divisible by M. Obviously we can't do it by putting a loop but we will do it by doing the basic maths. First let's write N1 and N2 and finally return them. If you have to define numbers from 1 to N, then how many are their sums? If I have to remove number 2 first, then it says that all integers in the range 1 are divisible by M. If there are numbers from 1 to N, then their sum will be N into N plus 1 by 2. How many numbers will be divisible by N from 1 to N? 1, 2, 3. How many numbers are divisible by N? How did you do it? How many numbers are divisible by N? Let's call it X. Let's call it X. Imagine all the numbers are written in this range. If I take M from all the numbers, then I take M from them. What will be the sum? What will be the sum? The sum will be N by M. Why N by M? Because it is N by M digits. You know what M is. It is X into X plus 1 by 2. This is the sum of all numbers that are divisible by M. Let's write N by M and first let's remove number 2. Who will be the divisible by M? X into X plus 1 by 2 into M. X into X plus 1 by 2 into M. Let's write M. What was number 1? Sum of all. Sum of all integers that are not divisible by M. Sum of all minus M by M. Let's remove all. How do we remove it? N into N plus 1 by 2. Let's submit it. Let's run it. Let's submit it. Time complexity big of 1 and space big of 1."}]
