For example, what we have to do is remove all duplicates from this array. If we say, we should make our output. The condition is that we don't have to take any other array. We have to replace this work which will be given in that array. And time complexity should be big of n. So time complexity is big of n and space complexity is big of 1. So let's start. We will use 2 pointer algorithm. 1 pointer will be used to traverse this entire array. 2 pointer will be used to put only unique elements in the array. So there will be 2 pointers. 1 will traverse the entire array. 2 pointer will do it. 2 pointer will help us to keep unique elements in the array. Let's see how it will help us. Initially, I and J will point the first element. The logic is that we will check each element and see. Is this unique? This is unique from the previous element. If it is not unique from the previous element, then keep J there. And move the i-on. But if it is unique, then the i-on will increase. J will also increase. And we will put the new unique element on the new J. So what is the algorithm? i will keep increasing. J will increase only when we get a new element. If we get a new element, then we will increase J. And J will put a new element on the new element. But if we do not get a new element, then we will keep J there. And we will keep increasing. Okay, that's great. So let's start. Initially, I and J are on the first element. Then what will happen? Then we will increase the i-on. Now I came here. Now he saw if this element is equal to the previous element or different. So he saw that this is the same. So what will we do? We will keep J there and increase the i-on. Increase the i-on. Now we checked again. Is this i-on different from the previous element or the same? So what will we do this time? We will increase the j-on. What else will we do? We will put two elements on the new j-on. The unique element. Okay, we put two elements. Let's go. Then we will increase the i-on again. We increased the i-on. Is this different from the previous element? Yes, it is different. So what will we do? We will increase the j-on. And we will striker the unique element on the j-on instead. No need of striker, right. Then what will we do? Decide on the i-on. Increase the i-on. Then we saw if it is unique from the previous one. Yes it is unique. Then we will increase the j-on. Then increase the j-on and hit the 4 on J instead. Then increase the i-on. Increased the i-on. We saw if it is equal from the previous one or not. It is equal then we keep the J there. Great. Then we increased the i-on again. Then see if this is equal from the previous one or different then it is different. Then we will increase the j-on. and 5 will be given to newJ okay sir J increased and 5 was given to newJ low high now the story is over why it is over? because i is the last one so our answer will be that much so this is our algorithm let's see the code so this is our code what is happening in this? one array will be given in this what we have to return we have to return this index okay why? because we will be given the entire array in question okay and we have to remove the duplicate in place we don't have to return any new array so what we have to do? so basically we will return a pointer which i will tell you that the unique element is from this pointer after that there is no difference okay so in this question will it return function? that pointer will return as far as our unique element is later there is no difference anything will happen so what was our unique pointer? as soon as we see a new element we increase it one okay, very good so in the beginning i saw that both the pointers were on the starting i.e. on the 0th index so what is unique? unique means that one unique element is already found very good so what we did? in the beginning both the indexes were on the first number so how many unique elements have been found? one because the first element must be unique that is why i did from the next element i.e. the second element i is equal to 1 okay then we are seeing the previous element is equal or different if it is equal then move ahead if it is not equal then increase the unique and in the old element give it a crack very good and finally return how many unique elements have been found or what does it mean? that index where we have unique elements"}]
