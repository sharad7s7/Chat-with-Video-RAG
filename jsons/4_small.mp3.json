In this question, there will be a binary array given, which means 0 and 1 will be the only one. And we have to do it, we have to remove maximum consecutive ones. Like here, there are two consecutive ones and three here. So what will be the three of them? What will be the answer? It will be three. It's a very good question. Now see, if I give an answer, what is happening? Here, all are going to arrays. What is this? That is, the answer will be all the arrays. Even if it is not the same, it will be the same answer. So all are the arrays. What does this mean? Whenever, remember, whenever the array questions come, you should see once, what can be the question from the sliding window. Here, let me tell you that the question will be easily answered from the sliding window. No problem. Now see, what happens in the sliding window? Suppose, at this time, the sliding window is sliding. It happens in the sliding window. Suppose, the window is only one. Then the second time, one came. Now see, the first time the one came, it is our answer. Obviously, because till now, the answer is, I don't have anything in the answer. Okay, now I am seeing this for the first time. I have run the loop. I saw this for the first time. So this is one. One is coming once. What does this mean? Our answer is still one. Okay, then the sliding window is this much. Okay, now how many are coming? One is coming. That is, the previous one was one. And now, which is the maximum of the two? Two. This means, now my answer is two. Okay. Now the sliding window will be this much. Now see, what is here? The condition is not met here. Zero is here. Okay. As soon as the condition is not met, we go back. That is, we will cut this from our window. We have cut it from our window. Now, again, see, is my condition matching? It is not getting connected. This means, cut this too. Okay. Now, see again. Now, see, is my condition matching? It is not getting connected. Cut this too from our answer. That is, from the window. Okay. The answer will still be two. Okay. Now, my window is over. Okay. Now, see, I have come here. Okay. The window is not here yet. Okay. What is its answer? Its answer is one. But what was the answer last time? Two was here. So, what is the answer now? Two is very good. Come on, the window is here. It is here. Okay. Very good. Now, the window is here. What will the answer be? Two will come. What was the answer for the last one? Two was here. This means, it will still be two. Because we are removing the max. Obviously, okay. Now, increase the sliding window. Now, we will get three answers from here. You were already given two. This means, the answer will be three. Now, listen carefully. Listen to me. I told you this. Any question is the way to do it from the sliding window. Any question. What do we have to do? This will be the photo. Okay. Take its screenshot. This will be the photo in every sliding window. There will be a pointer on the left. There will be a pointer on the right. Okay. What do we have to do? We have to hold the right and go in our answer. In one bar. In one bar. Keep the loop on. So, this will be the first time. In the second bar, we will also open this. Both will be done. Okay. Okay. So, we will open the window again and again. But, I have put a condition here. If anything comes that the condition does not match, then we will destroy the sliding window from the back. Destroy from the back. Do some logic to remove left from the window and left plus plus. That is, we will keep increasing the pointer. Okay. And update the answer. We will do the sum that I was doing. Okay. Now, it is not in the sum. No problem. It will come. I said that we have to do the first one. We have to increase the sliding window. Now, let me do the window instead of the sum. For you. This is my window. What do we have to hit in the window? We have to hit the right. Nums of right. That is equal. Okay. Okay. And then, what do we have to do? My answer is... Okay. I have also kept the answer as minus. We have to update the answer. What will happen in this case? Answer. What will happen in this case? The answer will be max. Math.max. Answer. And here, we will write something. Okay. And finally, we will return the answer. Okay. Now, watch carefully. What am I doing in the window? I am adding it in the window. Okay. But if you consider this is my window. So, what will we do? We will destroy it from the back. We will destroy it from the back. What will I add here? I will add a loop. Till the time... What did I tell you? We will add a condition here. Till the time our condition is unsatisfied. I am saying this again. Every sliding window will have the same photo. What will happen in the wild condition? Till the time our condition is unsatisfied, we will destroy it. Okay. We will write the condition unsatisfied here. What should I write? What should I write? Write it inside. What do we have to do with the sliding window? We have to destroy the left. That is, window minus equal to nums of left. Okay. We have to minus the window. Look, what is our window? Basically, anything can happen in the time. What is our window? Product can also happen. Anything can happen. Okay. And we have to plus the left. There is a point. Okay. Very good. Now, this condition is the condition. This is the point of the blind. What is the condition here? What is the condition for us? The condition for us is that, what should we always do? We should always be consecutive. 111. How should I write in that condition? Now, look. If this is the sliding window, what should I write? Sum will be 2. Okay. And what is the length? Look. The condition is clear. What is the sum of the window here? 3. And what is the length? 3. But if you look here, look here. If this is the window, somehow, let's take this. This window is here. Okay. So, look. The sum of the window is 2. But, how many are the three? What does this mean? We have got a condition. Which I don't have any problem with. While, right minus left plus 1. What will happen with this? The length of the window will be is not equal to. That is, until and until, what is this? What does this mean? That means, our condition is not satisfied. Okay. No problem. Until the condition is not satisfied, let's destroy it from the left. Keep it today. Okay. That's all. Okay. Very good. Now, I am updating the answer. But, what should I write here? What should I write here? Look. The answer will always be max. That's why I have written. The answer is, math.max Answer and current. Current. Okay. Current window. How will it come? This is written. This is written. Look. In this case, current window answer is this. That means, its length. The length of the window. If you want, it is only window. So, right minus left plus 1. Or, sum current. See, I could write sum here. Take out sum. Take out sum of these three. Take out sum of these two. That's what I am writing. But, my mind is very fast. Okay. We are smart. We can see. Because, look. It is 111. What does this mean? It means, the length of the window is equal to this. 111. 3 sum. 3 length. And we know that, we have to satisfy the condition till here. Because, because we have destroyed it from the left. Until the condition doesn't satisfy. Okay. Let's run it. This is not a curve. Sorry. Accept it. Submit it. Submit it. Now, let's see the time complexity. What do you think? Look at one loop. Okay. Is it one loop? Is it two loops? What do you think? N squared. But, big of N is time complexity. Why? Let me tell you. So, I have written the story here. The time complexity is big of N. Because the inner loop, that is, the loop of the while, only executes a constant number of times per outer loop. That is, look. When was N squared? N squared was then. When every outer loop, the entire inner loop was running. But, if I look here, for every outer loop, this constant bar is running. The left pointer, the left pointer. Just look at something else. You look at the right pointer and the left. The right one, is iterating only once. From 0 to N. It is understood. No problem. N means its length. But, the obvious one is not left. And, if I look at it, the left is also iterating from 0 to N. Look carefully. The left is never reset. What does this mean? This means that the right pointer is also increasing N at bar. And the left pointer is also increasing N at bar. This means the big of N time complexity. Not big of N squared.
